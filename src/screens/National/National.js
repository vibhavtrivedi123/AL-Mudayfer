        description1="Despite the close connection and clear connection between the activities of the companies of the Saleh Al-Mudaifer Sons Holding Group and the impacts on the environment from geological or industrial works and carbon emissions to industrial waste, the group was keen to put this matter in the highest consideration, so it developed a comprehensive and systematic plan to include all the work of the Saleh Al-Mudaifer Sons Holding Group and its factories. It applies strict national standards towards the environment and carbon emissions, and the group is environmentally friendly. For this reason, it has been partnered with the most prominent specialized companies to supervise and control with regard to the potential environmental impact resulting from the business, and to assist the group in obtaining the necessary national certificates in this field to confirm the solidity of the business."
        description2="On this side. Al-Mudaifer Holding has achieved tangible results as a result of this environmental concern, starting from preserving the health of its employees to preserving the general environment or surrounding the work and activities of companies and factories and reducing carbon emissions. Environmental commitment is one of the most prominent pillars on which the group’s work is based, which has reflected its excellence over time."
